# Language Model Program
Overview
This project involves the creation of a text generation program using Markov Processes and Monte Carlo methods. The program "learns" the style of an input text and generates new text that mimics the original authorâ€™s style. While the output can sometimes be nonsensical, it often retains the coherence and stylistic elements of the source material. By feeding the program text from famous works, such as Shakespeare's plays or Darwin's "The Origin of Species," we generate new passages that reflect those distinct writing styles.

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques for natural language processing (NLP) in an introductory computer science setting.
