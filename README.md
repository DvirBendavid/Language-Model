# Language Model Program
This project implements a **text generation program** using **Markov Processes** and **Monte Carlo methods** to mimic the style of any given text. Written in **Java**, the program learns from large text samples and generates new text that may either be coherent or nonsensical, depending on the input data. By training on works from Project Gutenberg, the program can produce outputs that reflect the distinct styles of authors like Shakespeare or Darwin. This assignment showcases the core principles of machine learning used in natural language processing (NLP), similar to those in modern applications such as spell checkers and chatbots.

## Features
- **Text Style Mimicry:** Learns the style of an author from text and generates similar outputs.
- **NLP Algorithms:** Uses Markov Chains and Monte Carlo methods for sequence prediction.
- **Written in Java:** Easy to compile and run on any Java-supported platform.
